__Note__: The interactive R console in the slides are working again as I  updated the OpenCPU API bindings.


## Integrated Learning Environment

This is a short demo of an integrated learning environment for teaching R. 

The basic idea is to be able to

1. Author a lesson using R Markdown
2. Embed interactive components seamlessly
3. Record the lesson as a screencast
4. Sync the screencast with the slides
5. Publish it online.

Thanks for watching this demo. It is still just a prototype and I would love to get some feedback. This demo uses several open-source projects, and I would like to give them due credit. 

First, I would like to acknowledge the `knitr` and `markdown` packages, which provide a simple, elegant authoring environment. 

Second, I would like to credit `OpenCPU` and `Shiny`, which allow R code to be executed on the server. This demo uses `OpenCPU`, but you can also run it from your laptop using `Shiny`.

Finally, I would like to thank Mozilla for `PopcornJS`, which makes it super easy to sync an html document with a video.
